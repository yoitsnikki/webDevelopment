- create ball
- give it radius small

- set up my array for levels (start with just one level)

LEVEL 1

LEVEL 2

LEVEL 3

P3
- learn how to make a button
- make the button under the textbox?

P2
- use an object constructor to make the ball appear when the game is started
- to start game, click on button start

BALL
- loop it constantly and clear canvas to get it there

BOTTOM OF CANVAS
- make shape, have it constantly loop, thus an event listener

- make the ball move everytime ENTER is clicked
- then, start with if loop
- so, FOR wordarray length
    if enter clicked
      if input == array.i then move up, else if
      input not == array.i then move down

    if ball touches bottom of canvas/shapes at bottom, then clear screen
    project GAME OVER
